Hi, I'm Robby. I currently work as a data scientist at Ally Financial operating across several business units. My day-to-day works usually consists of forecasting, statistical modeling, process automation, web application development, and a little bit of internal software development.

I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina where I graduated from UNC Charlotte with an Undergraduate degree in Engineering and a Masters degree in Mathematical Finance. After graduating in December 2017, I started working with Ally in their Charlotte office. In November 2019, I started working remotely in Boston, MA.

I heavily utilize R and Python, though I am personally much more partial to R. I think I have found good and balanced methods to use both to their strengths, but I am always learning new ways. I hope to use this blog to document interesting things I come across involving R, Python, statistics, software, finance, banking, or any other random interesting thing that catches my attention.
